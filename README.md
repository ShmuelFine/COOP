**COOP** stands for **C** **O**bject **O**riented **P**rogramming framework, developed by FineALGs (www.FineAlgs.com) with real time embedded systems in mind, 
along with our students from the Codalleh program (www.Codalleh.org)

COOP features **Classes** , **Inheritance** (including virtual functions), **Exceptions** (that call d'tors), **Memory management**,
our own **Unit Testing Framework** for C, and more.

It was tested both on Windows (Visual Studio, MSBuild) and Linux (GCC).

COOP aims to give lightweight syntax and minimal performance overhead for achieving efficient and **safe** embedded code.
