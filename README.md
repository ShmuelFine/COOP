**COOP** stands for **C** **O**bject **O**riented **P**rogramming framework, developed by FineALGs (now part of [Extra.Tech](https://extra.tech/)) with real time embedded systems in mind, 
along with our students from the Codalleh program (now part of [KamaTech](https://www.kamatech.org.il/))

COOP features **Classes** , **Inheritance** (including virtual functions), **Exceptions** (that call d'tors), **Memory management**,
our own **Unit Testing Framework** for C, and more. All of this while maintaining type safety and (many parts of the) intellisense!

It was tested both on Windows (Visual Studio, MSBuild) and Linux (GCC).

COOP aims to give lightweight syntax and minimal performance overhead for achieving efficient and **safe** embedded code.
All you have to do is to copy the COOP folder to you project and:
```cpp 
#include "COOP.h"
```

You can find a quick usage cheat sheet in the "The COOP Cheat Sheet.docx" file, and by going over the unit tests!

Have fun!
