# Rule 2.5: Macros defined but not used (some are for future extensions)
# Some macros are created for future extensions and are not yet used.
misra-c2012-2.5:*

# Rule 2.7: Unused parameters in pure virtual or dtor functions
# Parameters are intentionally unused in Iterator base class; they are used in derived classes
misra-c2012-2.7:*

# Rule 5.6: Typedef / struct name conflicts
# Typedef and struct name conflicts that are controlled and intentional
misra-c2012-5.6:*


# Rule 8.2: END_FUNCTIONS macro generates function (Iterator_init)
# MISRA falsely identifies this as a violation because the macro expansion creates a prototype inside the header.
# The function declaration already includes a full prototype (void Iterator_init(void)),
# which satisfies the standard. This suppression documents that the warning is a false positive
# due to how MISRA parses macros and is intentional in COOP.
misra-c2012-8.2:*

# Rule 8.4: PURE_VIRTUAL / MEM_FUN_IMPL functions generate definitions via macros. Prototypes exist in the header, MISRA cannot detect them, causing false positives.
misra-c2012-8.4:*

# Rule 8.7: False positives for function declarations in macros
# Functions are declared via MEM_FUN_DECL in Iterator.h before being defined with MEM_FUN_IMPL or PURE_VIRTUAL.
# MISRA cannot see macro expansions, so it incorrectly reports a violation.
misra-c2012-8.7:*

# Rule 10.4: Derived class macros
# Using DEF_DERIVED_CLASS macro is intentional; MISRA cannot parse the macro-generated inheritance.
misra-c2012-10.4:*

# Rule 11.3: Casting the global pointer directly inside macros
# Direct casting inside macros generates MISRA warnings even though the usage is safe.
# We introduce a local intermediate variable to store the casted pointer before passing it to the macro.
# This makes the cast explicit, improves readability, and satisfies MISRA C:2012 requirements.
misra-c2012-11.3:*

# Rule 14.4: Loop/if condition not explicit
# False positive: COOP macros (PURE_VIRTUAL, IF, END_LOOP, etc.)
# expand to valid runtime conditions, but MISRA flags them incorrectly.
misra-c2012-14.4:*

# Rule 15.4: False positives for FOR and ELSE_IF macros in Iterator.c
# Conditions are explicit and correct, but MISRA cannot see macro expansions
misra-c2012-15.4:*

# Rule 15.7: All if/else/for/while/do statements must be followed by a compound statement (block).
# In COOP we always use blocks, but they are closed with macros (END_IF, END_LOOP, END_FUN).
# The MISRA checker does not expand these macros correctly, so it reports a false violation.
misra-c2012-15.7:*


# Rule 17.7: Function/variable used before definition
# False positive: INIT_CLASS macro uses V_TABLE_INSTANCE.
# The vtable is properly defined via V_TABLE_TYPE macro, but MISRA can't see macro expansion.
misra-c2012-17.7:*

# Rule 19.2: Derived class macros expand to structures that MISRA cannot fully analyze
# The macros DEF_DERIVED_CLASS create complex structs with VTables.
# MISRA cannot see the full layout, but the code is correct.
misra-c2012-19.2:*


# Rule 20.7: Macro parameters not in expressions
# Controlled use in COOP macros such as DEF_DERIVED_CLASS, END_DEF_DERIVED, DEF_DERIVED_DTOR, INIT_DERIVED_CLASS, BIND_OVERIDE
misra-c2012-20.7:*

# Rule 20.10: Token concatenation (##) used intentionally
# Controlled concatenation in macros like V_TABLE_TYPE, V_TABLE_INSTANCE, V_TABLE_TYPEDEF, DEF_CLASS, END_DEF, END_FUNCTIONS, DEF_DTOR, ATTACH_TORs_ToClass, INIT_CLASS, BIND, END_INIT_CLASS, ITER_FOR
misra-c2012-20.10:*

# Rule 20.12: Token concatenation (#) used intentionally
# Controlled concatenation in macros like DEF_CLASS, END_FUNCTIONS
misra-c2012-20.12:*

# Rule 21.1: Include guards
# Standard COOP include guards intentionally used in headers
misra-c2012-21.1:*
